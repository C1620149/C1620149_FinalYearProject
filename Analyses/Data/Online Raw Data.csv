Scoring the Individualistic Inventory is quite simple. For the 13 questions, the number of times that the statement from each pair marked ""1."" was chosen is counted. Then, the number of times the statement marked ""2."" was chosen is also counted. 

 

	
		
			Number of times you chose 1.
			Number of times you chose 2.
		
		
			 [SC_a3H2S66JzIQZKFD-Score]
			 [SC_bPkLAr3AbkRPKKh-Score]
		
	



 

If the number of times you chose 1. is greater than the number of times you chose 2., you are low in individualism.


If the number of times you chose 2. is greater than the number of times you chose 1., you are high in individualism.



Based on this, click below whether you are low or high in individualism:","Researchers are interested in which personality traits are associated with successful relationships. High scores in some traits are associated with a high rate of successful relationships, but high scores in other traits are associated with a high rate of failed relationships. 



Researchers have conducted an experiment on individualism and the success of relationships. In the experiment, participants were divided into those high in individualism and those low in individualism. 



In each group, the number of people whose relationships failed and the number whose relationships succeeded are recorded in the table below. Because participants do not always complete studies, the total number of patients in each group is not exactly the same, but this does not prevent assessment of the results.



Please indicate whether the experiment shows that having high individualism is likely to lead to failed or successful relationships.

Tbh I quite like music art and theatre, just like it less than the other stuff. And you can't have good music without having decent knowledge, and you can't understand music and theatre and art without a good contextual understanding. 
I also hope that you are enjoying quarantine with good music. although, I could not exist very well without music, 'cause I really hate silence. Like the silence you are putting me through now.
Also I'd recommend listening to the Happy fits, they're my favourite band. Music is pretty great.
